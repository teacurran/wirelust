| ![mbta bus tracker icon](/apps/mbta/bustracker/icon.png) | This is a widget for showing you real-time data about bus arrival times for a chosen stop. Using Next-bus satellite data you can have a very accurate prediction of when your bus is coming. Update, v1.5, 9/7/2010:  - all bus routes now supported - fixed errors with config not loading - refresh interval changed - checks for updates - widget made slightly larger to fit new route and stop names |
