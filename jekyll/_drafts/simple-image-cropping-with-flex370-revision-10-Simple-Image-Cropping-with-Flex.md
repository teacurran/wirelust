Here is a simple, pure as3, image cropper I wrote for Flex. I'll try do a post later in the week describing how to use it in Flash cs3 and cs4.

\[kml\_flashembed publishmethod=”static” fversion=”9.0.0″ useexpressinstall=”true” replaceId=”flex\_image\_crop” movie=”http://www.wirelust.com/apps/flex\_image\_crop/bin-debug/main.swf” width=”640″ height=”458″ targetclass=”flashmovie”\]

\[/kml\_flashembed\]

**Features:**

- Very Simple
- Allows you to set min and max values for height and width
- Holding shift key keeps aspect ratio

You currently have to do the cropping on your own, either in flash or server side. I will followup later with examples of how to do that.

To embed this into you application, all you have to do is:

```actionscript
"demo1.jpg");
	
	// imageBox is an mx:HBox in my mxml
// Set up the initial crop
 
```

You can then listen for CropBox.EVENT\_CHANGED to get the dimensions of the box as it changes:

```javascript
// snipped ...
 
```
