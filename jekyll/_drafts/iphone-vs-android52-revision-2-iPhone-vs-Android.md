Last night I had been waiting for about two weeks to hear back from apple about membership in the iPhone developer program. I'm told this is normal wait time and I should just keep waiting.

At one point, I was thinking to myself “crap, this is reason enough to take another look at android and see what that has to offer”… but then I realized, I may be waiting for my application from Apple, but I couldn't have installed an android app on any phone anywhere anyway. duh. quit complaining self.

They finally contacted me today asking me to fax them in some information. Lets see how long the next step takes.
