Will HTML5 kill Flash?  
The iPad this past week reinvigorated a debate that has been brewing for the past few years. Will HTML5 kill flash on the web.

Is Apple trying to kill flash?  
Probably not:  
 – Apple contends that their lack of flash support is squarely because of Adobe  
 – Steve jobs held up an iPad several times with the flash missing plugin missing. This will loose them some sales. Steve doesn't make mistakes on stage. so why was he bringing up pages with flash. Perhaps to get people angry to help pressure adobe to release a more streamlined version? Perhaps to shame a team within apple that is supposed to get flash working? This does seem to be in-line with Steve's reputation for an in your face management style.

1\. HTML5 isn't finalized and standardized yet  
The browser vendors can't agree on things like video codecs. It's all well and good if you say that HTML5 can do video, but if they can't agree on what video codecs to use then suddenly you are back in the days where your website had to support multiple codec streams. If the iPad takes off, I expect the two streams people choose will be Apple's video format, and flash for everyone else. Good for Apple but not good for standards.

2\. Flash has a huge developer community.  
The thousands and thousands of people who make their living aren't going to just jump and learn a new technology.

3\. Flash is all about the tooling  
Flash is largely so popular because they have the best tooling. In fact, tooling is entirely what Adobe is about. You can do some fancy stuff in Javascript and HTML but a lot of creative people out there can't be bothered to write the code required, and why should they? Flash does a great job of letting people visually design an application and make a lot of it work without ever writing any code.

4\. Adobe isn't sitting on their hands.  
This talk of HTML5 overtaking flash assumes that adobe is going to sit around for the next two years and not do anything. With flash Catalyst coming out soon, they will be propelling their tooling way ahead of CS4 and way way ahead of the non-existent tools for HTML5.

5\. Frameworks take years to mature  
No one has time to write a project from scratch. Frameworks take care of most of the hard stuff now a days. Javascript frameworks are getting mature but currently don't make a lot of use of the Flash-killer features of HTML5. It will most likely take a year or two before some really great frameworks start to crop up.

6\. RTMP

Android is growing fast and it will have Flash and Tablets very soon.  
What are your iPad friends going to say when you have a similar device from google that can run Hulu?
