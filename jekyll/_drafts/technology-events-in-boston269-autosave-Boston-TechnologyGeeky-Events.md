Just for my own reference, I've been maintaining a calendar of tech or new-media related events in Boston for years now. It just recently dawned upon me that there aren't many lists like this published so I decided to make mine available. When my work is slow I look at the calendar and see what is going on. I try to make it to one or two events a month.

One frustration I have is that so many events are announced with only a week or so notice. Organizers, please release as many details as early as you can, it will get more people to go to your event. If you know of anything going on that I don't have on my list, please, send it along.
