Often times in computing we run into issues related to inter-operability of competing, legacy, or simply alternate systems. Who am I kidding? Often times? I feel like inter-operability issues are the bulk of all work I do.

One of the oldest tasks that still plagues us with problems today is simply calculating and storing dates.

What is Time?  
Time, like most things we take for granted as being simple, is actually quite complicated. It is part of our universe and we all experience it, but why, and how? According to Einstein with his equation E=MC2, time is just a variable related to other constants in the universe. According to these laws, time is simply something that can be sped up, slowed down, stopped or reversed. This certainly doesn't make it easy to calculate ones place in time. After all – we can't take real time measurements of the speed of light or the power of energy, whatever that means.

Luckily for us, we don't have to measure time. We only have to measure time of one thing in relation to something else. In our case, time is usually measured as the Earths position relative to stars, mainly the Sun. This is easy to calculate because, well the sun is always there and observable.

Now that we've agreed to measure time relative to the Sun, we just have to agree how to count our time.

Calendar Systems  
Calendars are a relatively new invention. If you consider that modern humans have been around for 200,000-500,000 years, it is sort of odd to think that we have only been measuring time for 4000 of those years, maybe less.

Gregorian

Epochs  
An Epoch is just the word for any signifigant marker in time used to measure something. In computing, there are only two major epochs to consider:

CE/BCE (BC/AD) – the birth of christ – the basis for our calendar, but doesn't come up that much because it is rare we have to measure dates so old.

January 1, 1970 – this was decided to be the epoch of modern computers. Many systems today store time as a count relative to this date. When talking about computing systems, just saying the term ‘epoch', almost always refers to the count of milliseconds from this date.

Leap Years

Daylight Saving Time
