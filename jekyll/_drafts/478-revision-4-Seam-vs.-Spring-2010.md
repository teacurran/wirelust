Frameworks are like cars. There are dozens of brands of cars out there that pretty much do the exact same thing. When you buy a car you test out several and buy the one that feels right to you. Despite their very similar feature set, if you take the time to truly test drive several frameworks, one will feel better to you than the others.

I will start by saying, that after extensive test drives and real project usage, I like Seam better. I don't think it is right for everyone but it is right for me.

I've been finding myself getting into the Seam vs. Spring argument with people lately, and as evidenced on the internet, so have a lot of other people. The arguements usually boil down to:

**Spring proponents:**

- EJB sucks, we are not EJB, spring is the anti-EJB
- There was a competition, but we won, as evidenced by our market share
- We can do everything Seam can do, so why would we try Seam
- Full EJB Application servers suck
- Spring is the best framework EVER.

**Seam proponents:**

- We are standardized through JCP (or will be soon)
- Full EJB Application servers rule, but we can do tomcat if we have to
- Spring has too much XML
-
