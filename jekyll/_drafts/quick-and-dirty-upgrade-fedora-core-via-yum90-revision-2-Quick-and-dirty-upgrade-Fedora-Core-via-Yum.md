First off Fedora has an [awesome FAQ](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/YumUpgradeFaq) for how to upgrade your OS with Yum. If you don't care for all that reading and thinking, here is a quick and dirty set of notes I have been using to upgrade several servers. This is

This process is more likely to hose your config files, so make sure you have them backed up somewhere. (I use subversion for everything in /etc).

This also assumes you are runlevel 3. duh.

1\. if you are connected via ssh, use screen. Screen will save your life during long running processes, and generally you should be using it all the time anyway.

```php
 
```

3\. remove anything you don't need or use, it will just waste time and cause conflicts. For me, I often find things like OpenOffice or Audio Programs on headless servers:

```php
yum remove | OpenOffice
```

4\. change your repository. The FAQ says you can do this with just installing the fedora-release-10-1.noarch.rpm. but that doesn't seem to work for me. It gets a conflict that you also need the release notes. This seems to work better:

```php
wget ftp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/10/Everything/i386/os/Packages/fedora-release-10-1.noarch.rpm
 
wget ftp://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/10/Everything/i386/os/Packages/fedora-release-notes-10.0.0-1.noarch.rpm
 
rpm -u *.rpm
```

5\. clear out the old caches and files so it can detect that you need to update:

```php
yum clean all
```

6\. At this point you can just run “yum upgrade” and cross your fingers. I like to do smaller updates of packages with a lot of dependencies. I have had good results with combination of upgrades like this:

```php
 
```

  
The last one of course upgrading anything not already touched by the others. 7\. Depending on your configuration and what you have installed you will probably still have some dependency issues that will need to be resolved. It wouldn't be life without some issues though right?
