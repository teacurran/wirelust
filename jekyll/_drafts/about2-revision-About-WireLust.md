I, Terrence Curran (Tea), am a software consultant living and working in Boston.

I started this blog to start recording notes about my day to day tech related experiences and challenges.

My background is primarily as an enterprise java web developer, but I hope to write up articles on all sorts of things I am interested in or playing with.

Hopefully something on this site will be helpful to someone else out there.
