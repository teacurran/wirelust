About five years ago [Ben Sisto](http://www.51570.org/) had an idea for an application that I thought would be useful. The idea being that if you want to download images from Google image search — it takes forever to go through the results, wait for them to load, and save the images that aren't 404. The application Ben envisioned, would simply download every result and ignore the ones that were 404 or took too long to load.

I quickly banged out a release that was workable in a few days and never really looked at it again.

This week, I needed to download a ton of images from Google and needed to use the application again. When I fired it up, it seems Google changed their site so it wasn't working anymore. In the past five years someone has probably released something similar, a firefox plugin or something, I don't know – but I fixed up this application and got it working much better than the original.

So here it is. 1.0 release of Picture Pump (named after the site Ben ran at the time – HoneyPump):

You just need Java 1.5+ to run it. If you have OSX 1.4+ you should be all set. Windows click below to get it:

Once you have java, click Launch to launch the application.
