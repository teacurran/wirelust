NBC Video Rewind:  
-Rewind is just that, only gives you the last few episodes of each show.  
+Video player is decent  
-makes it difficult to switch between shows.  
+Commercials don't require an extra click.  
-player seems to try to get you to read about each show when switching shows, rather than just switching  
-each show has to be hand selected, no play all function.

ABC:  
-player is a little klunky  
-choosing a show interface seems more interested in selling you other shows than delivering the show you want to find.  
-doesn't have complete season's of shows. if you are a new viewer and someone told you to check out lost, starting with the middle of season 2 isn't going to help you become a fan

Vice TV:  
+player allows you to continuously watch show after show

Comedy Central:  
-still thinks people want to watch “clips” of shows.  
+complete daily show archive online
