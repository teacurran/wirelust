Emma wrote [a blog post](http://digitalemma.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/mgh-north-shore-center-microsite/) about how she finds AS3 overly difficult and un-neccessary for the type of work she does. I think that she might be right, AS2 is easier for simple actions and page layouts, but there must be some reason people are upgrading their code. When I talked with her about it, I found myself wanting to tell her that AS3 the way to go for every project but I couldn't come up with a concrete list of reasons why AS3 is better. I decided to put some thought into it and come up with a good summary of why AS3 is the future and AS2 is legacy.
