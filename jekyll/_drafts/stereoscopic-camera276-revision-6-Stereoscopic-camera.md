Last month [Gillian](http://www.gillianbowling.com) asked me to help her with an event that she had promised to shoot in 3D. I think I've gotten Gillian to adapt some of my “how hard could it be” attitude over the years.

After a ton of Googling, and realizing that that [fancy Fuji3d camera](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/3d/camera/finepix_real3dw1/) wouldn't be out in time. I decided to tether two Canon SD750's using the plans described on [this fine blog](http://3dbruce.blogspot.com/).

After getting all the parts I needed and set up, I chickened out when it came to soldiering wires directly to the internals of the camera. I am a little rusty with my soldiering and I had a 1 week deadline. If I ruined either of the cameras I wouldn't be able to get another in time for the event.

Luckily, there is a whole community dedicated to exactly what I wanted to do and they had some simple solutions that didn't require any permanent alterations to the cameras. A little bit of light soldiering and cutting and we were in business. The camera came out great and worked perfect for the event.

For the mount I used aluminum that I cut with a jigsaw and file, then riveted together. For the electronics all I needed was a few usb cables, an audio cable and jack, a momentary push button, and a 4 AA battery pack. All in all, it cost about $75 in parts – including the rivet gun. I already had 1 camera so the second one I got for $100 on ebay.

Merging the photos taken was trivial with [StereoPhoto Maker](http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stphmkr/). An awesome piece of free software that I wish was open source so it could be ported to OSX, or better yet a CLI version.

Here is one of the images Gillian took that night. Any pair of red-blue glasses should work with it. You can see the whole gallery [here](http://www.zanazazzi.com/gallery/album384). I have a few more shots from around the city on [my Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/teacurran/sets/72157622238579827/) stream.
