> You are receiving this email because you have a login, ‘terrencecurran', on the Apache JIRA installation, https://issues.apache.org/jira/
> 
> On April 6 the issues.apache.org server was hacked. The attackers were able to install a trojan JIRA login screen and later get full root access:
> 
> https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/apache\_org\_04\_09\_2010
> 
> We are assuming that the attackers have a copy of the JIRA database, which includes a hash (SHA-512 unsalted) of the password  
> you set when signing up as ‘terrencecurran' to JIRA. If the password you set was not of great quality (eg. based on a dictionary word), it  
> should be assumed that the attackers can guess your password from the password hash via brute force.
> 
> The upshot is that someone malicious may know both your email address and a password of yours.
> 
> This is a problem because many people reuse passwords across online services. If you reuse passwords across systems, we urge you to change  
> your passwords on ALL SYSTEMS that might be using the compromised JIRA password. Prime examples might be gmail or hotmail accounts, online  
> banking sites, or sites known to be related to your email's domain, approachingpi.com.
> 
> Naturally we would also like you to reset your JIRA password. That can be done at:
> 
> https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ForgotPassword!default.jspa?username=terrencecurran
> 
> We (the Apache JIRA administrators) sincerely apologize for this security breach. If you have any questions, please let us know by email.  
> We are also available on the #asfinfra IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
