I've been searching for a good Excel-like grid widget that can be embedded in web-apps.

Here is my wishlist:

- Looks nice
- Allows inline cell editing
- good Javascript API or extensibility
- Supports as many functions as possible, Excel functions would be nice
- Open source (LGPL or something similar)

Here are the projects I found that meet the most of these requirements:

- [dhtmlXGrid](http://www.dhtmlx.com)
- [Sigma Grid](http://www.sigmawidgets.com)
- [Simple Spreadsheet](http://www.simple-groupware.de/cms/Spreadsheet/Home)
- [Socialcalc](http://socialcalc.org/)
