 – sql server out of the box is superior to both MySql and PostgreSql  
 – it is the tools that make SQL server great, not the database engine itself.  
 – MySql Administrator tools are constantly in beta, have bad UI, and are lacking features.  
 – SQL server tools are clean, easy to use, very reliable, and constantly evolving into better and better tools.  
 – Most websites don't use the complete feature set of any database.  
 – Most small sites I see don't use any indexes on their databases at all, but are using DBs to store just a few thousand records so it doesn't matter.  
 – flat text files would often perform just as well.
