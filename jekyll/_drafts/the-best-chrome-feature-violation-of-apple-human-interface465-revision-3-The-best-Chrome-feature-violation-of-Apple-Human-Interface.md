The best feature of Google Chrome on OSX: It violates the Apple Human Interface Guideline.

[Popup Menu's](http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TPXREF132)  
Use a pop-up menu to present up to 12 mutually exclusive choices that the user doesnâ€™t need to see all the time. Sometimes a pop-up menu can be a good alternative to other types of selection controls.

[Keyboard Focus and Navigation](http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGUserInput/XHIGUserInput.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000361-DontLinkElementID_1550)  
In default keyboard access mode, focus moves only between fields that receive keyboard input.
