The OSX Dictionary screen saver is totally awesome. It gives you a handy word of the day as the screen saver. Why didn't I see this in any of the reviews of Leopard out there?

As a side note, every time mine starts up it flashes the word “scrimshaw”. This is pretty awesome, but I am curious: does it do this for everyone? Is this some sort of inside apple joke?
