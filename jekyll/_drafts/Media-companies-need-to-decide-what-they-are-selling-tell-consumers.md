 – media companies need to distribute their products with a License  
 – consumers think they are getting one license, media companies think all sorts of other things  
 – putting a simple, clear, license on every piece of media sold is the only way to sort it out once and for all  
 – companies can't decide if they are selling plastic discs, per user licenses, or per device licenses.

 – Sony BMG seems to think that they are selling per-device licenses:

 – CDs were never per-device, they are more akin to per-user since you can bring a cd anywhere and play it anywhere.  
 – The only reason they like this per-user license is because it is not perpetual, CDs tend to wear out and get ruined over time

 What consumers want, and often think they are purchasing:  
 – a perpetual per-user license for a piece of media in all forms.  
 – if you pay for the CD, it is okay to make the mp3 from the cd.  
 – it is further okay to download the mp3 from a server (the thought is that you already own it)
