Emma wrote [a blog post](http://digitalemma.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/mgh-north-shore-center-microsite/) about how she finds AS3 overly difficult and un-neccessary for the type of work she does. I think that she might be right, AS2 is easier for simple actions and page layouts, but there must be some reason people are upgrading their code. When I talked with her about it, I found myself wanting to tell her that AS3 the way to go for every project but I couldn't come up with a concrete list of reasons why AS3 is better. I decided to put some thought into it and come up with a good summary of why AS3 is the future and AS2 is legacy.

### It's Faster

AS3 has a new virtual machine that executes code up to 10x faster than AS2.

### It's Stricter

AS3 will complain more if your code isn't properly written. I know to some developers this seems like a big downfall but it is actually a good thing. Stricter compile checking will help you by finding more bugs at compile time. It's much better to find and fix your bugs when you are working than try to hunt them down weeks later when your client is complaining

### Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are one of the most powerful items in your toolbox in any language but often are intimidating to even very experienced developers. The concise format of regex often intimidates and confuses people. If you are doing any work that deals with parsing or searching text, you should spend some time to learn even some basic regular expressions. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) of course is a good place to get a good overview of some regex basics. [This snippet](http://snipplr.com/view/6608/as3-regular-expression-basics/) gives some simple examples of regex in AS3.

### New API

### Better Exception handling

Referenced in this article, but I don't see more detail:  
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/actionscript3\_overview.html

### Adobe says it is the future

This is sort of abstract â€” but generally you want to try your best to develop with technologies that are new and being actively developed by the technology vendor. If adobe says it is concentrating on AS3, it means that new features and improvements are most likely going to be AS3 only or AS3 first.
