Microsoft and Asus just launched a new site called It's Better with Windows ([link](http://www.itsbetterwithwindows.com/)).

The main premise of the site is that Windows is familiar and Linux is different and scary.

The marketing premise sounds reasonable but I think the problems with Microsoft is that they actually believe it. They believe that consumers would rather have something familiar than have something better.

I'm not saying Linux on a netbook is better than Windows. I am saying though that I think this familiar argument is what caused Microsoft to hemmorage market share in the Mobile space in the past few years.

It's farmiliar was their primary selling point for why you should buy Windows Mobile and not Palm. Palm fell flat on it's face for other reasons and microsoft found itself the number 1 player in the smartphone market. Sitting on the top as MS tends to do, led them to stop trying to improve their product.

When Apple and then Google came around with their mobile offerings, they had a UI that was totally unfarmiliar to everyone, but substantially better. Now Microsoft is caught playing catch up. They are just now coming to grips with the fact that the Windows Start Menu paradim is not the end-all be-all best UI for every device.

Microsoft should be making a custom version of windows with a netbook centric UI that takes advantage of the small screen and stop trying to cram windows into everything. It is only a matter of time before Apple and Google release netbooks and leave them wondering why people aren't yearning for a start menu and taskbar.
