wow. months of the blog world jerking off to today's fantasy finally ended with everyone feeling a little disappointed. The iPad is here, and we are all once again, wondering what we will use it for. I wasn't going to post about it but there are a few things I think people are overlooking.

### A4 Processor. whaaa?

We knew apple bought a processor manufacturer so this isn't a total surprise but it is a big move that I think will impact things more than people realize.

First, apple is now in the business of once again using proprietary technology instead of off the shelf components. While it may be totally awesome now, Apple runs the risk of chips from other companies getting way faster quicker than their own and users waiting years for upgrades like in the PowerPC days. Luckily Apple has gone through processor switches before and knows how to package binaries that work on multiple architectures.

Second, and I think perhaps more significant, using a custom processor could stop other operating systems dead in their tracks. If apple doesn't provide the right specs or compilers, it could be forever before we can see Chrome OS or any other Linux running on their hardware, which is too bad.
