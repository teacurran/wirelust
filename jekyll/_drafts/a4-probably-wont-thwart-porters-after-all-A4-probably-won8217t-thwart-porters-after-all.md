[![Apple A4 Chip](http://www.wirelust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/a4-apple-chip-top-1-300x168.jpg "Apple A4 Chip")](http://www.wirelust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/a4-apple-chip-top-1.jpg)

So In yesterday's post, I posited that a custom chip from Apple might make it impossible for people to port other operating systems to the iPad hardware.

It turns out, according to [this artice](http://www.brightsideofnews.com/news/2010/1/27/apple-a4-soc-unveiled---its-an-arm-cpu-and-the-gpu!.aspx) over at Bright Side of News, the A4 is simply a system on a chip. It is an ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore CPU mashed together with memory and other functions.

Porting something like linux to the iPad won't be easy but it should be possible. As far as I know, no alternative operating systems have been successfully run on the iPhone and the iPad will probably have a very similar story. Theoretically, iBoot from the [iPhone Dev Team](http://wikee.iphwn.org/) is close to getting an Linux to load on the iPhone. Let's hope they can bring some of the same know-how to the iPad.
