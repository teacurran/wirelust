I hear a lot of people who use one platform or another speculate as to why desktop Linux doesn't take off, why it hasn't reached the masses, and why people keep using Windows. The latest of this speculation comes from none other than the man himself, Linux Trovalds (interview [part 1](http://linux-foundation.org/weblogs/openvoices/linus-torvalds-part-i/), [part 2](http://linux-foundation.org/weblogs/openvoices/linus-torvalds-part-ii/)).

I find that the problem with a lot of these interviews and articles often focus on opinions and raw speculation, they often don't offer any real comments from people who have tried to make the switch or real world user testing.

This is going to be my contribution, why I don't use Linux on my desktop.

Background

First off, let me say that I am not a Luddite. I am very technical savvy compared to the average person, and I come at the switch to Linux from a technical person's point of view.

I first installed Linux and started attempting to use it on my desktop in 2000 with version 6.1. Since then I have tried several times to give it a go, and have always found myself frustrated and coming back.

This article will describe my latest attempt to use Linux on my primary desktop computer. I have a strong desire to use all Open Source software and will go out of my way to use it in favor of proprietary systems, but at the end of the day I need a system that I can use end to end without spending 50% of my day fighting against my computer.
