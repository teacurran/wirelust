Some quick CLI commands I use all the time but forget the exact syntax for.

Find all files that have been modified in the past 7 days

```bash
 
```

Find all JPEGs that have been modified more than 30 days ago

```bash
 
```

Move all JPEGs from the current folder (recursively) that are greater than 40k into the folder /tmp/2

```bash
 
```

Clean subversion metadata out of a directory

```bash
'{}' \;
```

Use the above to make an export of a working copy by doing:

```bash
'{}' \;
```

Any command that is deleting files will prompt you for each file. to go through them all without prompts, just run the command as root

```bash
'{}' \;
```
