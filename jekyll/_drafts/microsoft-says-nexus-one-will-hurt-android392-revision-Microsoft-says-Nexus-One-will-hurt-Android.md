[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/01/microsoft-googles-nexus-one-will-hurt-android.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss) has an article talking about how Microsoft Entertainment and Devices President Robbie Bach came out and said that the Nexus One will hurt Android. Basically, he said that Microsoft thinks releasing your own device will scare off 3rd parties from using your Operating System.

I think comments like this that continually come out of Redmond highlight why Microsoft struggles so much connecting with customers. Microsoft has taken the strategy that focusing on OEM partners is more important than focusing on user experience. Windows mobile was the dominant smart phone OS on the market for years because they did a great job signing up hardware makers. Unfortunately they didn't pay any attention to end users and as soon as something better came along their demand disappeared.

Google has taken the right strategy, focus on the customer experience first, worry about the hardware vendors later. If the public is excited to use your software, the hardware companies will follow, especially if you don't charge any Licensing fees.

I wonder if Robbie Bach thinks that hardware manufacturers wouldn't wet their pants at a chance to run OSX on their own devices. With his logic they wouldn't want to because Apple already makes a good phone.
