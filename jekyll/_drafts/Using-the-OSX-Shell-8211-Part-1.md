It always amazes me how many people I know that use OSX and don't know a single shell command. I can't go more than an hour without opening up Terminal and interacting directly with the system. I guess it speaks to the quality of the operating system that most users can live without knowing that an entirely different interface for more advanced users exists.

### Shell commands you should know

1\. pwd  
returns the current directory, essential for telling where in the filesystem you are  
2\. ls  
list's files in the current directory  
3\. cp  
copies files from one directory to another.  
4\. mv
