[Sloppy](http://www.dallaway.com/sloppy/) is a tool I use all the time to test out sites in. It will load any site and simulate a slower connection than you are currently using. It used to be great to see how your site loaded on a 56k modem â€” now I use it to test how my sites load on a cell phone connection.

It also works cross platform without any install thanks to Java Web Start.
