FPO: post about the save icon and the concept of saving documents

OLPC Human Interface Guidelines  
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC\_Human\_Interface\_Guidelines

> “We believe that the traditional “open” and “save” model commonly used for files today will fade away, and with it the familiar floppy disk icon. The laptops do not have floppy drives, and the children who use them will probably never see one of these obsolete devices. Instead, a more general notion of what it means to “keep” things will prevail. Generally speaking, we keep things which offer value, allowing the rest to disappear over time. The Journal's primary function as a time- based view of a child's activities reinforces this concept.”
