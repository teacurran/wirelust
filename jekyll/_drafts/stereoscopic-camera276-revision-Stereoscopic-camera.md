Last month [Gillian](http://www.gillianbowling.com) asked me to help her with an event that she had promised to shoot in 3D. I think I've gotten Gillian to adapt some of my “how hard could it be” attitude over the years.

After a ton of Googling, and realizing that that fancy Fuji3d camera wouldn't be out in time. I decided to tether two Canon SD750's using the plans described on [this fine blog](http://3dbruce.blogspot.com/).

After getting all the parts I needed and set up, I chickened out when it came to soldiering wires directly to the internals of the camera. I am a little rusty with my soldiering and I had a 1 week deadline. If I ruined either of the cameras I wouldn't be able to get another in time for the event.

Luckily, there is a whole community dedicated to exactly what I wanted to do and they had some simple solutions that didn't require any permanent alterations to the cameras. A little bit of light soldiering and cutting and we were in business. The camera came out great and worked perfect for the event.
