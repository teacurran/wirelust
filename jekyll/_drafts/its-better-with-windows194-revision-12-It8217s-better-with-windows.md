Microsoft and Asus just launched a new site called It's Better with Windows ([link](http://www.itsbetterwithwindows.com/)).

The basic premise of the site is that Windows is familiar and Linux is different and scary. </div>The marketing premise sounds reasonable but I think the problems with Microsoft is that they actually believe it. They believe that consumers would rather have something familiar than have something better.

I'm not saying Linux on a netbook is better than Windows. I am saying though that I think this “familiar” argument is what caused Microsoft to be totally blindsided in the mobile space in the past few years.

“It's familiar” was their primary selling point for why you should buy Windows Mobile and not Palm. Palm fell flat on it's face a few years later, but not because all the users were finally convinced that the Microsoft UI paradigm was superior. As MS tends to do, once they because the dominant player in the space, they completely stopped trying to improve their product.

**Microsoft: People aren't as loyal to the start menu as you think. The lower cost the device the more true this is.**

When Apple and then Google came around with their mobile offerings, they had a UI that was totally unfamiliar to everyone, but substantially better. Now Microsoft is caught playing catch up. They are just now coming to grips with the fact that the Windows Start Menu and tiny icons isn't how people want to interact with their phone or PDA.

Microsoft should be making a custom version of windows with a netbook centric UI that takes advantage of the small screen and stop trying to cram windows into everything. It is only a matter of time before Apple and Google release netbooks and leave them wondering why people aren't yearning for a start menu and taskbar.

Another side note, the secondary argument they are making, is that “Windows has better device support than any other platform” is just absurd. Anyone that has plugged in an older or a newer printer or scanner into a Windows computer knows that more often than not the computer doesn't know what the hell to do with it. At this point, OSX tends to recognize way more devices and know exactly what to do with them way better than Windows.
