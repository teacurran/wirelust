The very first domain name I ever bought was [tacoland.com](http://www.tacoland.com). I accidentally let it expire and it was registered within days by a link farm company and then later sold to BuyDomains. man I hated them so much. Five years later I did some work for BuyDomains. I probably could have gotten it back cheaply, but I realized it was a stupid site anyway.

A few weeks after tacoland, I registered [GrilledCheese.com](http://www.grilledcheese.com), a site I still like but haven't updated in like 9 years. Ah well.
