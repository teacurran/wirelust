looking for something in my office yesterday yielded 11 cards on my desk that were not in any computers. this is probably not good.

My order from [Ultimarc](http://www.ultimarc.com/) came in. I am starting work on a DIY version of one of [these](http://www.surface-tension.net/), for about 1/10th of the price they charge. It probably won't look as sweet, or be as powerful, or run windows. but it will run ms pacman and that is all that really matters to me.

I had a lot of issues with the video card and NIC but was able to swap them out with different ones from the pile in the first photo. It runs very fast since it has fast hard drives and a ton of ram. yay!

Also, in apple news. They announced today that they will have an SDK for the iPhone in Feb. This may be enough to get me to buy one. I am tempted to start bringing some of my cocoa libs up to speed with 10.5 now so I can write apps when it comes out. I really want to get off of Windows CE for my phone and this could be awesome. But then again the Nokia N810 looks like it may be even way awesomer. I was kind of hoping Sun would have revived the SavaJe phone by now, but it looks like they are going to be slow and under deliver so I am not going to hold my breath.

In the nice to dream DIY category, there is a [company](http://www.fragtag.com.au/) in Australia that sells DIY laser tag kits. Basically they sell all of the electronics, you make the guns. It means that you can make a custom gun for about $300-$500 rather than pay the $3k-$4k for the other pro systems out there. The only problem is that even though I'm willing to pay that much for a gun, I don't know if enough other people would be willing to in order to get a proper game going. I would maybe even make two, but I think it takes six people at least to have a good game. I'll keep it in the back of my mind for next summer.
