Just a follow-up to that post a few entries ago about the OSX kernel panics I was getting.

I had hoped 10.5.1 would fix them, and they seemed to get a little less frequent when I installed that. What really seemed to do the trick was upgrading to the latest version of [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) which I almost always have running.

It has now been 5 days since a Kernel panic.

For the horse race: I was getting 2 a day with 10.5.0, and one every other day with 10.5.1.

I think it is solved. We will see.
