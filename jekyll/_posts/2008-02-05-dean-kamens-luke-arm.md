![Dean Kamenâ€™s Luke Arm](http://www.wirelust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/lukearm.jpg) If you had any doubt that [Dean Kamen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kamen) and his team were the best engineers out there, check out [this video](http://spectrum.ieee.org/video?id=221) of the Luke Arm. Their earlier demos were pretty neat, but this one really shows off the devices abilities. Hopefully they leave it with that chrome exterior when they release it on the public.
