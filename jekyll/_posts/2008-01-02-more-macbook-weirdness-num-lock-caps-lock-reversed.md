Maybe my Macbook is messed up because I seem to get way more weird issues with it than other people I talk to.

Today it started doing this thing where it thinks the number lock and caps lock buttons are reverse what they should be. In order to type normal, I have to have both the lock lights turned on, rather than turned off. Toggling them on or off seems to work normal, it just thinks that a green light means turned off rather than on.

A bit of digging turns up that it seems like I'm not the only one with this problem. [A forum post](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=6209489) says that resetting the [PRAM](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=2238) fixes the issue, but so does resetting the computer without doing anything sometimes so I don't know.
