The [Apache Http Components client](http://hc.apache.org) changed quite a bit from 3.0 to 4.0 beta. It wasn't entirely clear to me from the documentation how to set request headers and cookie policies with the new client. After a lot of fishing around I was able to figure it out, here is the code for anyone trying to do the same thing.

Downloading a page with the 3.0 client:

```java
"http://www.twitter.com/teacurran");
 
// set a faux User-agent
"User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)");
 
// set the cookie policy
 
```

here is the same thing with the 4.0 client:

```java
"http://www.twitter.com/teacurran");
 
// set a faux User-agent
get.addHeader("User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)");
 
// set the cookie policy
 
```
